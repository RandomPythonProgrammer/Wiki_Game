# Wiki_Game
Simple wiki game:
- run the script to start
- it will give you 5 seconds to look at the destination page
- it will then bring you to the start page
- using the links on that page navigate the to specified page
- once you reach the end point the program will give you a score and show you your path
- you may go to stop.com to stop and restart.com to restart
- I realize you can cheat very easily but I am too lazy to render html in python
